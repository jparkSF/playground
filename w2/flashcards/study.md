 ### What is a base case in recursion? Why do we need one? Do we always need one?
 ### What exactly is a Stack Overflow?

 ### What are the common HTTP methods? When are they used, and what do they accomplish? (This is a big one)

Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

Describes the communication options for the target resource.

 ### In which phase does hoisting occur?
 ### What is the difference between function hoisting and variable hoisting?
 ### What is a state tree in the context of Redux?
 ### Why don't we want to modify (i.e. mutate) our redux state?
 ### What is a pure function? Impure function?
 ### Describe in detail what a redux reducer is. What makes it a pure function?

 ### What is hoisting?
> - The behavior of “moving” var and function declarations to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase is called hoisting.
